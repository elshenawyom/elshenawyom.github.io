abstract = {This is an expository paper on fibrations in the context of higher homotopy groups. The paper does not assume any pre-requisite knowledge, adopting a rather axiomatic approach. We direct our focus towards fibrations and show how one can apply this powerful machinery to compute homotopy groups. One main result regards the loop-space fibration, which shifts the homotopy group by one degree. Another highly non-trivial result utilisies the Hopf fibration to prove that the homotopy groups of S^2 and S3 coincide for n ≥ 3. The goal of this paper is to trivialise and familiarise, and to equip the reader with the right ideas for a more developed treatment of the subject.}

abstract = {We already know that tic-tac-toe is a solved game, meaning it is determined if both players play their best. This is, however, not so clear for the game of Chess. We will first start with a good game of tic-tac-toe, then refine the intuition into rigor on our way to proving the first formal theorem in the theory of games, credited to Ernst Zermelo. In full generality, we show that in two-player finite games of perfect information, there is always a strategy to reach a win or draw; with no regard to what the strategy should be. One could then ask the following question. Given a winning position, how quickly can a win be forced? We conclude the talk with a reflection on Zermelo’s findings as well as the powerful, non-intuitive consequences of his results.}

preview = {banachtarski.jpg},
abstract = {Contrary to common belief, the result by Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski is not at all paradoxical, and rather challenges our intuition about the notion of infinity. In this article, we introduce a paradoxical decomposition of F2, the free group on two generators, then extend this notion by the embedding of F2 in Euclidean space R3. We conclude with a few notes on non-measurability, and reflect on criticism of the Axiom of Choice.}
