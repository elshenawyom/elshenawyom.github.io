## `i.` a prelude {#pe}
<div style="margin-top: 30px;"></div>
As part of the State, Religion and Secularism course under Professor Manfred Hinz, we chose to address the Rwandan genocide; one of the most catastrophic human tragedies to this day. Specifically, we highlight the historical role of the Church as a moral compass in the hands of the Rwandan state, and the consequences that follow.  

By we, I acknowledge my dear collaborator Parth Vaya, who is Rwandan in origin. This research project has been nothing short of fun, and I would like to thank him for tolerating my many shortcomings.
