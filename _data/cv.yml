      institution: Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, US
      year: "06.2024 — "
      description:
        - a complete regular map is an embedding of a complete graph \(K_n\) into a \(g−\)holed surface that exhibits maximal symmetry. Norman Biggs [1972] constructed such maps as Cayley maps associated to finite fields. James and Jones [1985] proved Biggs’ construction gives all complete regular maps. We propose an alternative construction that emphasizes an interesting interplay between elements of Algebraic Number Theory and Topological Graph Theory.

      institution: Constructor University, Bremen, Germany
      year: "11.2022 - 02.2023"
      description:
        - the Bose-Einstein condensate is a state of matter formed when bosons occupy the same quantum state at ultracold temperatures, leading to macroscopic quantum phenomena. We aim to compute the interaction energy between two quasi-particles in a homogeneous Bose gas beyond Bogoliubov theory, identifying regimes of attractive and repulsive interactions based on their momenta. The study of mathematical physics demands great rigor, and an early pursuit of this goal implied a remarkable step towards mathematical maturity.
