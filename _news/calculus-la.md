I am now officially a teaching assistant for the Calculus & Linear Algebra class, taught by Professor Sören Petrat. As my very-first teaching assistant position, I find it an overwhelmingly great opportunity to engage in thoughtful mathematical discourse with students, one that I very much look forward to. 

The course should proceed as outlined on Prof. Petrat's [website](http://math.constructor.university/petrat/teaching/2022_fall_calc_lin_alg_I/). Added to that, [here](teaching/cla-1) is a new page for all tutorial materials, which I will (try my best to) update weekly. 

While this is clearly a methods class, I will do my best to motivate the ideas and schemae involved. I would naturally be compelled to do so, especially as a mathematician who rarely accepts facts without proofs. Unless they were axioms, of course — these you cannot really prove. Well, you can, but you have to come up with another set of axioms that may not be proven. [I think I'll stop here...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems)<br>
