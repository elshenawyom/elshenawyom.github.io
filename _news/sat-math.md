Yet another teaching position, with a small twist — this time, I am not the teaching assistant, but **the course instructor for 200+ students**. It seems to be the first time in the history of this university that an undergraduate student is appointed such a huge responsibility. A great honour, but...

To give some context, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) is a standardized test required for university admission. One admisssion policy is that students may be granted admission on the pretext that they exceed a certain threshold on the SAT. My goal is to help the students prepare for the 7th of December slot. 

One huge obstacle lies in the way, namely is the lack of any structure or plan whatsoever. Another obstacle is that I only received the role in October, meaning that one full month of classes is already due. The situation is indeed critical.

I have already set out a topic-based approach that emphasizes on continous loops of feedback. This would ideally be implemented using the [CollegeBoard Educator QuestionBank](https://satsuitequestionbank.collegeboard.org/digital/search), then utilising `moodle`'s immediate feedback tool to streamline this approach for all students. There is argubaly not a more effective way to capture each student's individuality and cater to their needs.

This seems to reduce the problem to a simpler one, namely the time-effectiveness of a digital transfer of ~800 CollegeBoard questions to `moodle`. Let us see how this unfolds.<br>
