The IMC is a university competition in mathematics for undergraduate students. This will be my first-ever participation in a competitive event. The competition is held in Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria, for six days between the 5ᵗ​ʰ of August and the 11ᵗ​ʰ of the same month.

My goal for the competition is to make a surprise. I also expect it to be a new challenge with things to pick up and improve on.


Grateful is one of many overwhelming feelings that befall me. I did not have these opportunities growing up, mainly due to the lack of awareness and mentorship within the community I grew up in. One of many far-fetched goals I is to see Egyptian teams and students participating in the IMC one day. This might just be the beginning. <span style="float:right;">  $$\boxed{\xi}$$</span>
