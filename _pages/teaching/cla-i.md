<!-- incorporate the exercises later -->


This is a methods-based Calculus class, with great focus on applications. The final three weeks entail a glimpse into some of the main foundations of Linear Algebra. Nevertheless, rigor is utilised in the treatment of the course. Below you may find topics covered in my tutorials, week by week.<br>


1. [Numbers, Quadratics and Polynomials](/teaching/cla-i/week-1/)
2. [Binomial Coefficients, Polynomial Division & Sketching](/teaching/cla-i/week-2/)
3. [Continuity, Limits, Asymptotes, Induction](/teaching/cla-i/week-3/) <!-- $$\epsilon-\delta$$ -->
4. [Extreme Value Theorem, Bisection Method and the Squeeze Law](/teaching/cla-i/week-4/) <!-- The Exponential Function, and the Derivatve as a Linear Approximation -->
5. [Derivatives with Examples, Implicit Differentiation, and the Oscillating Circle](/teaching/cla-i/week-5/)
6. [First-and-Second Derivative Analysis, Sketching](/teaching/cla-1/week-6/)
7. [A Full Sketch of $$f(x)=\frac{x^2}{4-x^2}$$, Integration Methods](/teaching/cla-i/week-7/) <!-- by Substitution, by Parts, by Anti-Derivative, -->
8. [Riemann Integration, Integral Mean Value Theorem, Partial Fractions](/teaching/cla-i/week-8/)
9. [Area between Curves, The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Taylor's Series](/teaching/cla-i/week-9/) <!-- , , Two Arguments for the Taylor Series, The Gamma Function -->
<!--[9.0 Solving the 2020 Midterm Exam by Professor Marcel Oliver]-->
10. [Separable Differential Equations](/teaching/cla-i/week-10/) <!-- , and Newton's Law of Cooling-->
11. [Span, Linear Independence, and Basis Vectors](/teaching/cla-i/week-11/)
12. [Vector Spaces, Matrices as Linear Maps, Composition of Matrices](/teaching/cla-i/week-12/)
13. [Systems of Linear Equations -- Solutions & Geometric Interpretation](/teaching/cla-i/week-13/)<br>

The following series contains 100 videos, amassing 19 hours and 30 minutes of simple walkthrough tutorials to the course's weekly problem sets.

In addition to the standard tutorials, I gave two exceptional lectures on behalf of Professor Petrat. They are included below, accompanied by recordings of some tutorials.
