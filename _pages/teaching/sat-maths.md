<!-- incorporate the exercises from your lms later -->
## abstract

We outline an effective two-month study plan for the mathematics module of the Scholastic Assessment Test in December. The module encompasses itself in a set of nineteen skills which we aim to cover during the standard lecture period. This is supplemented with three topic-specific worksheets, sorted by difficulty. 
<div style="margin-top: 10px;"></div>
All exercises within this plan belong to the official CollegeBoard Educator Question Bank, and are characterised by not being present in any official full-length practice test. Thus, students taking this course need not worry about an overlapping with their standard preparation material. Note that time we spend on each topic is consistent with its frequency on the test.

**You may plan your attendance accordingly.** For instance, if you are particularly strong with the skill of Equivalent Expressions, then you definitely do not need to attend, and should instead focus on completing the respective worksheet.

## reminder
<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
... and always remember, 

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
it is not possible to truly appreciate Mathematics without an eager and questioning mind and a spirit that is not afraid to experiment, to make mistakes and profit from them, to accept frustration and persevere to the ultimate triumph. Those who are able to cultivate these qualities will find themselves richly rewarded, both in their study of Mathematics and their appreciation of all that life has to offer.
