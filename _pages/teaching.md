Here you may find an extended teaching portfolio. You are highly encouraged to disturb me with any finite number of questions, inquiries, (or) bad math jokes you may fathom. Feel free to [reach out!](/assets/pdf/pdf.pdf)

... and always remember, 

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
it is not possible to truly appreciate mathematics without an eager and questioning mind and a spirit that is not afraid to experiment, to make mistakes and profit from them, to accept frustration and persevere to the ultimate triumph. Those who are able to cultivate these qualities will find themselves richly rewarded, both in their study of mathematics and their appreciation of all that life has to offer.
