Hi there! 

I am an undergraduate student of mathematics. Right now I am in the research group of Professor Lisa Berger, working on an interesting intersection of Topological Graph Theory and Algebraic Number Theory.



With that being said, very few things do not pique my interest. I enjoy applying practical rigour to meaningful constructions. My involvement extends to projects in data analytics, finance, IT & software, project management, and teaching.


At the intersection of all these facades lies someone who is not afraid to experiment, to make mistakes and profit from them, to accept frustration and yet persevere to an ultimate triumph. $$\boxed{\xi}$$

a few technical nice remark introduction words about yourself

hard working, learns easily, dedicated, and light-hearted

has many interests. does math problems research bcs its fun, does teaching bcs its meaningful (check out my statement), and does project management, finance, coding, etc.. because it's practical

learns very fastly. 

In my free time, I like football, chess, and read books,  or play .

cycle and play football.
